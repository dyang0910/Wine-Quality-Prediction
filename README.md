# Wine-Quality-Prediction

  Assessing wine quality is an important component of wine production, as it heavily
influences the marketing and wine certifications. Typically, this process relies on sensory
evaluations from wine experts; however, wine classification is a difficult task since taste, as a
human sense, is not highly understood or completely standardized. Recent advances in data
mining and ML offer the potential to build predictive models for wine quality. These models
could help streamline the certification process and provide insights for quality improvement.

  In this report, we apply and compare several machine learning methods to predict wine
quality based on physicochemical data. The dataset contains both red and white wine samples,
with measurements such as alcohol content, pH, acidity, and other data, alongside quality ratings
assigned by human tasters. Our goal is to build regression and classification models that
accurately predict the sensory quality score and to evaluate the performance of different ML
techniques.

  We will explore many modeling approaches, including multiple linear regression,
decision trees, random forests, local regression, and boosting, all implemented in R. By
comparing these models based on predictive accuracy and interpretability, we aim to identify the
most effective method for predicting wine quality from physicochemical attributes. We will also
conduct a final analysis comparing classification vs. regression modeling to obtain the method
we see as most suitable to achieve our previously stated goal
